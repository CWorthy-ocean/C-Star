        This test ensures that the `get` method correctly handles creating partitioned ROMS grid files
        from a local `roms-tools` YAML file.

        The method being tested involves:
        - Calling the parent class `get` method to retrieve or symlink the source YAML file.
        - Replacing the symlink with a local copy of the YAML file.
        - Parsing the YAML file to determine the roms-tools class it describes.
        - Modifying the YAML to include correct start and end times for time-varying datasets.
        - Creating the roms-tools.Grid object from the modified YAML.
        - Saving the Grid object as partitioned netCDF files corresponding to ROMS' domain decomposition.

        - mock_rt_grid_instance: Mocks the instance of the roms_tools.Grid class and its save method.

        - local_roms_yaml_dataset: Provides a ROMSInputDataset with a local YAML source.
        - mock_resolve: Mocks Path.resolve to simulate resolving a symlink to the actual file path.
        - mock_yaml_load: Mocks yaml.safe_load to return a dictionary with too many sections.

        Asserts:
        --------
        - Ensures `mock_resolve` is called to resolve the symlink to the actual path.
        - Ensures `mock_yaml_load` is called to parse the YAML file.
        - Asserts that a ValueError is raised when the YAML file contains more than two sections (Grid and one other).
