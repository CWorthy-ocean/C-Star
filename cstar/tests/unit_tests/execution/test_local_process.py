class TestLocalProcess:
    """Tests for the `LocalProcess` class.

    This test class covers the functionality of the `LocalProcess` class, which is a subclass
    of `ExecutionHandler` designed to manage task execution in a local subprocess. It validates the
    class's behavior across its lifecycle, including initialization, starting processes,
    monitoring status, and cancellation.

    Tests
    -----
    test_initialization_defaults
        Ensures that default attributes are correctly assigned during initialization.
    test_start_success
        Verifies that the subprocess starts successfully with valid commands and updates the status.
    test_status
        Confirms the `status` property reflects the process's lifecycle states (e.g., RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED).
    test_drop_process
        Tests the behavior of the private _drop_process method.
    test_status_unknown_no_returncode
        Validates that the status is `UNKNOWN` when the subprocess state cannot be determined.
    test_cancel_graceful_termination
        Ensures that `cancel` gracefully terminates a running process using `terminate` without requiring `kill`.
    test_cancel_forceful_termination
        Confirms that `cancel` forcefully terminates a process using `kill` after `terminate` times out.
    test_cancel_non_running_process
        Validates that `cancel` does not attempt to terminate or kill a non-running process and provides feedback.
