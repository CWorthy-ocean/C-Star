    This class handles the execution of commands as local subprocesses,
    allowing users to monitor their status, stream output, and manage
    lifecycle events such as cancellation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    commands : str
        The shell command(s) to be executed as a subprocess.
    run_path : Path
        The directory from which the subprocess will be executed.
    output_file : Path
        The file where the subprocess's standard output and error will
        be written.
    status : ExecutionStatus
        The current status of the subprocess, represented as an
        `ExecutionStatus` enum value.

    Methods
    -------
    start()
        Start the subprocess using the specified command.
    cancel()
        Cancel the running subprocess.
    updates(seconds=10)
        Stream live updates from the subprocess's output file for a
        specified duration.
