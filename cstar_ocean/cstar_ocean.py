    print('We are living in a climate crisis. Whether this lasts for decades, or indefinitely, depends on the actions that governments, companies, and communities take today. It is well understood that we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions and transition to new systems of energy, food, and waste management. However, to limit warming to ambitious 1.5° C or 2° C targets, we also need to remove massive amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, transforming landscapes to store it in ecosystems and developing industrial means of storing it underground. This is the legacy of being slow to act. ')
