# What is C-Star?

C-Star is an open-source modeling system developed by a team of oceanographers at [\[C\]Worthy](https://cworthy.org). It is designed to support Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) for ocean-based Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). C-Star aims to provide an accessible, common framework for creating, sharing, and (crucially) reproducing ocean system simulations. 

Our priorities are:
- Scientific credibility
- Reproducibility
- Accessibility
- Transparency

We aim to build a database of "blueprints" describing scientifically validated CDR simulations. These will be used with C-Star such that a range of stakeholders can easily recreate those simulations for analysis.
