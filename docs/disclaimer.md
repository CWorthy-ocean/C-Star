> [!Warning] 
> **This project is still in an early phase of development.**
>
> The [python API](https://c-star.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) is not yet stable, and some aspects of the schema for the [blueprint](https://c-star.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terminology.html#term-blueprint) will likely evolve. 
> Therefore whilst you are welcome to try out using the package, we cannot yet guarantee backwards compatibility. 
> We expect to reach a more stable version in Q1 2025.
