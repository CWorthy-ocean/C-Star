.. _v0.1.0:

v0.1.0
------

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add support for river forcing
- Add support for forcing corrections (used in legacy ROMS configurations)

Breaking Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Merge Case and Component classes into a single class, Simulation, simplifying internal/blueprint structure. Remove old Case and Component modules.
- Rename `caseroot` to `directory` 
- Rename BaseModel to ExternalCodeBase
- Remove `start_time` and `end_time` parameters from `InputDataset.get()`, these are now obtained from the corresponding attributes
- Rename `ROMSComponent.namelists` to `ROMSSimulation.runtime_code` and `ROMSComponent.additional_source_code` to `ROMSSimulation.compile_time_code`

Internal Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Update calls to `roms-tools` to reflect latest changes in API
- Update internal/test blueprints to reflect new structure
- New backend data retrieval system `cstar.io`
- Add ROMSRuntimeSettings class with ability to parse and create roms `.in` files
- Save partitioned `ROMSInputDatasets` in the same directory as their un-partitioned versions, rather than a subdirectory "PARTITIONED"

Documentation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Run most examples in documentation locally (unless HPC-specific), so HPC access is not required
- Add 'How-to Guides' section
- Remove tutorial page on using roms-tools
- Replace all URLs to other doc pages with relative links

Bugfixes:
~~~~~~~~~
- Complete missing unit test coverage from Case and Component in new Simulation modules
- Add `expanduser` to `Path` instances to allow tildes to represent root in paths
- Correct issue where `AdditionalCode.modified_files` list indices did not correspond to `AdditionalCode.files`
