    "The \"Simulation\" is the primary object of C-Star, and contains all the information needed to run a particular simulation. Once prepared, Simulations can be stored in [\"blueprints\"](../terminology.html#term-blueprint),  - `.yaml` files telling C-Star what goes into each Simulation and where to find it. These blueprints can then be shared with other parties interested in reproducing the simulation described by the Simulation.\n",

    "In this guide, we will create a ROMS-MARBL C-Star Simulation ([ROMS](http://research.atmos.ucla.edu/cesr/ROMS_page.html) for ocean physics modeling, [MARBL](https://eesm.science.energy.gov/projects/marine-biogeochemistry-library-marbl) for biogeochemistry) and export it to a blueprint.
