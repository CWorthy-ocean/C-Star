    "In C-Star, the `InputDataset` holds information on, and offers methods relevant to, files containing numerical data required by a simulation (such as initial conditions). This can be compared with [the `AdditionalCode` class](LINK-TODO), which is related to text-based files needed by a simulation (such as lists of custom settings).\n",
